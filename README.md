# pizza-motion

This project is an interactive UI experiment built with React, designed to explore **dynamic user interfaces** and **smooth animations** using modern tools such as Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.  
The goal is to create a simple yet detail‑rich UI component that focuses on:

- **Designing a large, visually clear button**
- **Animating elements smoothly using a cycle animation**
- **Testing font rendering behaviors such as font‑weight and font‑smoothing**
- **Enhancing user experience through fast and direct interaction**
- **Building scalable UI components with clean and organized structure**

This project serves as a foundation for UI/UX experiments or as a starting point for more advanced interactive components.
